# Battery_warning

Not only a very low battery is bad, you should not charge your device more than 95%  
This application will allow you to keep a check on your device's battery.  
A low battery message is common in your system settings, but to take care of your battery's health, its a good practice to charge the device only upto 95%.  
So, this application runs in the background of your system and a message pop-ups to disconnect the charger when the charging completes upto 95%.  
To minimise the power used by the application, the program runs after a certain time which is calculated on the basis of charging/discharging rate.
